# findObjectInArray

Given a name (string) and an array of people (objects), find the person with the given name and return his/her hobby. Return false if there is no person with the given name.

DO NOT use people.find()

DO use a for loop.

TRY solving it with non-mutative recursion, only after youâ€™ve solved it using a for loop.
